    <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
    <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the page is a long one it might be split up
        into
        several sub-headings.</p>
    <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you follow the structure of what is being written. There may even
        be
        sub-sub-headings (or lower-level headings)</p>
    <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>Here you can see another sub-heading. But should this be a heading? Probably not. Too much info/text now.
        right?</p>
